============

Contributing to the documentation requires `a Github account <https://github.com/>`_. 
Make sure you are working in the correct branch for your version of ownCloud or 
client apps. If your edits pertain to multiple manual versions, be prepared to 
backport as needed.

To edit a document, you can edit the .rst files on your local system, or work 
directly on Github. The latter is only suitable for small fixes and improvements 
because substantial editing efforts are easier on your local PC. 

The best way is to install a complete Sphinx build environment and work on your 
local machine. You will be able to make your own local builds, which is the fastest 
and best way to preview for errors. 

Sphinx will report syntax errors, missing images, and formatting errors. The 
Github preview is not complete and misses many mistakes. 

Create a new branch against the master or stable branch you are editing, make 
your edits, then push your new branch to Github and open a new PR. 

To edit on Github, `fork the repository <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ 
(see top-right of the screen, under your username). You will then be able to make 
changes easily. Once done, you can `create a pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_ and get the changes reviewed and back into the official repository.
