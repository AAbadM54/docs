======================
Changing the web route
======================

This admin manual assumes that the owncloud server shall be accessible under the web route
``/owncloud`` -- this is also where the Linux packages make the server appear.

Basic system administrator and apache configuration knowledge is prerequisite.
Several configuration files need to be kept in sync, when changeing the web route location.

On an Ubuntu-14.04 system the follwing files are typically involved:

- /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/owncloud.conf
- /var/www/owncloud/config/config.php
- /var/www/owncloud/.htaccess

Example: Moving from /owncloud to /
-----------------------------------


::

    vi /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/owncloud.conf
      Alias / "/var/www/owncloud/"
    ZZ

    vi /var/www/owncloud/config/config.php
      'overwrite.cli.url' => 'http://localhost/',
    ZZ

    vi /var/www/owncloud/.htaccess
    ...
      #### DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE ####
    ...
      <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteBase /
    ...
    ZZ

    # optionally also set your document root. (Not recommended)
    vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
      DocumentRoot /var/www/owncloud
    ZZ


Note:
  Since owncloud version 9.0.2 we support short url's without index.php. The rewrite mechanisms
  involved a RewriteBase rule in .htaccess which is autogenerated when
  owncloud is first started. Depending on the exact way how owncloud was installed (upgrade or fresh,
  plain tar archive, or packages) you may or may not yet find a RewriteBase in your .htaccess files.
  If it is not yet there, make sure to double check once the ownCloud server is up and running.
