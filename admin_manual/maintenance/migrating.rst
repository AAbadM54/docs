Migrating to a Different Server
===============================

If the need arises ownCloud can be migrated to a different server. A typical use case would be a hardware change or a migration from the virtual appliance to a physical server. All migrations have to be performed with ownCloud offline and no accesses being made. Online migration is supported by ownCloud only when implementing industry-standard clustering and high-availability solutions before ownCloud is installed for the first time.

To start, let us be specific about the use case. A configured ownCloud instance runs reliably on one machine. For some reason (e.g. more powerful machine is available, but a move to a clustered environment not yet needed) the instance needs to be moved to a new machine. Depending on the size of the ownCloud instance the migration might take several hours. As a prerequisite it is assumed that the end users reach the ownCloud instance via a virtual hostname (a ``CNAME`` record in DNS) which can be pointed at the new location. It is also assumed that the authentication method (e.g. LDAP) remains the same after the migration.

.. warning:: At NO TIME any changes to the **ORIGINAL** system are required
    **EXCEPT** putting ownCloud into maintenance mode.

    This ensures, should anything unforeseen happen, you can go
    back to your existing installation and provide your users
    with a running ownCloud while debugging the problem.

#.  Set up the new machine with your desired Linux distribution. At this point you can either install ownCloud manually via the compressed archive (see :doc:`../installation/source_installation`), or with your Linux package manager (see :doc:`../installation/linux_installation`).

#.  On the original machine turn on maintenance mode and then stop ownCloud. After waiting for 6-7 minutes for all sync clients to register the server as in maintenance mode, stop the application and/or Web server that serves ownCloud. (See :ref:`maintenance_commands_label`.)

#.  Create a dump from the database and copy it to the new machine, and import it into the new database (See :doc:`backup` and :doc:`restore`).

#.  Copy ONLY your data, configuration and database files from your original ownCloud instance to the new machine (See :doc:`backup` and :doc:`restore`). 

.. note:: You must keep the ``data/`` directory's original filepath. Do not change this!

5. The data files should keep their original timestamp (can be done by using ``rsync`` with ``-t`` option) otherwise the clients will re-download all the files after the migration. This step might take several hours, depending on your installation.

#.  With ownCloud still in maintenance mode (confirm!) and **BEFORE** changing the ``CNAME`` record in the DNS start up the database, Web server / application server on the new machine and point your Web browser to the migrated ownCloud instance. Confirm that you see the maintenance mode notice, that a logfile entry is written by both the Web server and ownCloud and that no error messages occur. Then take ownCloud out of maintenance mode and repeat. Log in as admin and confirm normal function of ownCloud.

#.  Change the ``CNAME`` entry in the DNS to point your users to the new
    location.




Example

Note: For this example to work, you need ssh on both servers and the PermitRootLogin to be set to "yes" on the new server.

Install SSH

apt install openssh-server openssh-client -y

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
...
PermitRootLogin yes
...

1. Install ownCloud

2. Maintenance mode

cd /var/www/owncloud/

sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --on

wait for 6-7 min

service apache2 stop

3. Export and Import the database

cd /var/www/owncloud/

Export on original server:

SYNOPSIS

mysqldump --lock-tables -h [server] -u [username] -p[password] [db_name] > owncloud-dbbackup_`date +"%Y%m%d"`.bak

Example:

mysqldump --lock-tables -h localhost -u admin -ppassword owncloud > owncloud-dbbackup.bak

Parameters are set when creating database for ownCloud:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS owncloud;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON owncloud.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Export command:

rsync -Aaxt owncloud-dbbackup.bak root@new_server_address:/var/www/owncloud 

Import on New Server:

mysql -h localhost -u admin -ppassword owncloud < owncloud-dbbackup.bak

4. Copy data, config to new server

rsync -Aaxt config data root@new_server_address:/var/www/owncloud 

IMPORTANT!
You must keep the data/ directoryâ€™s original filepath. Do not change this!

5. Maintenance off

- ownCloud in maintenance mode (check)

- start up the database

service mysql start

- start up Web server / application server on the new machine

service apache2 start

- point your Web browser to the migrated ownCloud instance

localhost/owncloud

-confirm that you see the maintenance mode notice (check)

- no error messages occur (check)

-take ownCloud out of maintenance mode (on new server)

sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off

- log in as admin and confirm normal function of ownCloud


6.
Change the CNAME entry in the DNS to point your users to the new location.
