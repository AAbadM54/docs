You have tested the appliance with your Active Directory environment, 

deleted it and now want to go in to production or test it again and 

you can't include the appliance in your environment again?

The solution is - you have to clean up the prevouis DNS entries on your Domain Controller.

After that, you should be able to include the appliance again in your Active Directory environment.
