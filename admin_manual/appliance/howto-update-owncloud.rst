How to Update ownCloud 
======================

There are three options to update an ownCloud installation hosted on an ownCloud X Appliance:

- `Use the Univention Management Console`_
- `Use the Command Line`_
- `Use the Web UI`_

Use the Univention Management Console
-------------------------------------

After logging in to the Univention server, under "**Administration**", click the first option labeled "**System and domain settings**".
This takes you to the Univention Management Console.
From there, click the "**Software**" shortcut (1), and then click "**Software update**" (2).

This will load the Software update management panel, after a short time scanning for available updates.
If an update is available, under "**App Center updates**" you will see "**There are App Center updates available**".
If one is, as in the image below, click "**ownCloud**" which takes you to the ownCloud application.

When there, part-way down the page youâ€™ll see the "**Manage local installation**" section. 
Under there, click "**UPGRADE**".

Before the upgrade starts, a prompt appears titled "**App Installation notes**". 
This is nothing to be concerned about. 
So check the checkbox "**Do not show this message again**".
Then click "**CONTINUE**".

Next an upgrade confirmation page appears.
To accept the confirmation, click "**UPGRADE**" on the far right-hand side of the confirmation page.

This launches the upgrade process, which requires no manual intervention.
When the upgrade completes, the ownCloud app page will be visible again, but without the "**UPGRADE**" button.
Now, login to ownCloud by clicking the "**OPEN**" button, on the far right-hand side of the page.

Use the Command Line
--------------------

For upgrade via the web interface see below.
This is a documentation on how to upgrade the ownCloud App from 9.1.4 to 10.0.3 in UCS
First you will need to login to your UCS (Univention Corporate Server) instance, either via ssh or directly on your server.
You will need the credentials of the administrator account you have created during the UCS setup.
This are the Commands you will need:

::

  univention-app install owncloud

To remove the old App and install the new one. 
Your data and users will remain.

Optional commands
