ownCloud Server Tuning
======================

Using cron to perform background jobs
-------------------------------------

See :doc:`background_jobs_configuration` for a description and the 
benefits.

Enable JavaScript and CSS Asset Management
------------------------------------------

See :doc:`js_css_asset_management_configuration` for a description and the 
benefits.

.. _caching:

Caching
-------

Caching improves performance by storing data, code, and other objects in memory. 
Memory cache configuration for the ownCloud server is no longer automatic in 
ownCloud 8.1 and up, but must be installed and configured. See      
:doc:`caching_configuration`.

Using MariaDB/MySQL instead of SQLite
-------------------------------------

MySQL or MariaDB are preferred because of the `performance limitations of 
SQLite with highly concurrent applications 
<http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html>`_, like ownCloud.

See the section :doc:`../../configuration/database/linux_database_configuration` for how to
configure ownCloud for MySQL or MariaDB. If your installation is already running on
SQLite then it is possible to convert to MySQL or MariaDB using the steps provided
in :doc:`../../configuration/database/db_conversion`.

Tune MariaDB/MySQL
--------------------

A comprehensive guide to tuning MySQL and MariaDB is outside the scope of the ownCloud documentation.
However, here are three links that can help you find further information:

- `MySQLTuner <https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl/>`_.
- `Percona Tools for MySQL <https://tools.percona.com/wizard>`_
- `Optimizing and Tuning MariaDB <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/optimization-and-tuning/>`_.

Tune PostgreSQL
---------------

A comprehensive guide to tuning PostgreSQL is outside the scope of the ownCloud documentation. 
However, here are three links that can help you find further information:

- `Five Steps to PostgreSQL Performance <http://de.slideshare.net/PGExperts/five-steps-perform2013>`_
- `Tuning the autovacuum proceff for tables with huge update workloads (oc_filecache) <http://grokbase.com/t/postgresql/pgsql-admin/103qcpdrpf/tuning-auto-vacuum-for-highly-active-tables#20100323hfs3jtjuaywwufukoqtexkpjti>`_

Using Redis-based Transactional File Locking
--------------------------------------------

File locking is enabled by default, using the database locking backend. This 
places a significant load on your database. See the section
:doc:`../../configuration/files/files_locking_transactional` for how to
configure ownCloud to use Redis-based Transactional File Locking.

SSL / Encryption App
--------------------

SSL (HTTPS) and file encryption/decryption can be offloaded to a processor's 
AES-NI extension. This can both speed up these operations while lowering 
processing overhead. This requires a processor with the `AES-NI instruction set 
<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`_.

Here are some examples how to check if your CPU / environment supports the 
AES-NI extension:

* For each CPU core present: ``grep flags /proc/cpuinfo`` or as a summary for 
  all cores: ``grep -m 1 ^flags /proc/cpuinfo`` If the result contains any 
  ``aes``, the extension is present.   

* Search eg. on the Intel web if the processor used supports the extension 
  `Intel Processor Feature Filter 
  <http://ark.intel.com/MySearch.aspx?AESTech=true>`_ You may set a filter by 
  ``"AES New Instructions"`` to get a reduced result set.
   
* For versions of openssl >= 1.0.1, AES-NI does not work via an engine and 
  will not show up in the ``openssl engine`` command. It is active by default 
  on the supported hardware. You can check the openssl version via ``openssl 
  version -a``
    
* If your processor supports AES-NI but it does not show up eg via grep or 
  coreinfo, it is maybe disabled in the BIOS.
  
* If your environment runs virtualized, check the virtualization vendor for 
  support.

Tune Apache 
-----------

Enable HTTP/2 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to improve the speed of an ownCloud installation, while at the same time increasing its security, you can `enable HTTP/2 support for Apache`_.
Please be aware that `most browsers require HTTP/2 to be used with SSL enabled <https://caniuse.com/#feat=http2>`_. 

Apache Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Apache process uses around 12MB of RAM. 
Apache should be configured so that the maximum number of HTTPD processes times 12MB is lower than the amount of RAM. 
Otherwise the system begins to swap and the performance goes down. 

Use KeepAlive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `KeepAlive`_ directive enables persistent HTTP connections, allowing multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP connection. 
Enabling it reduces latency by as much as 50%. 
In combination with the periodic checks of the sync client the following settings are recommended:

::

	KeepAlive On
	KeepAliveTimeout 100
	MaxKeepAliveRequests 200

MPM
~~~

`Apache prefork`_ has to be used. 
Donâ€™t use threaded ``mpm`` with ``mod_php``, because PHP is currently not thread safe.

Hostname Lookups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

	# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        ...
	HostnameLookups off

Log files
~~~~~~~~~

Log files should be switched off for maximum performance.
To do that, comment out the `CustomLog`_ directive. 
However, keep `ErrorLog`_ set, so errors can be tracked down.
