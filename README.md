# ownCloud Documentation (v2)

This project is a port of the ownCloud documentation, that was previously generated using [Sphinx-Doc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), to [Antora](./docs/antora.md).
Fundamentally, not that much has changed.
All of the same information is still available.

However, here’s what has changed:

1. The platform (and tools) used to build the documentation
2. The file format that the documentation is written in, which is [AsciiDoc](./docs/asciidoc.md).
3. The <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> & <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> of the documentation

## Contributing to the Docs

If you've been contributing to the previous version of ownCloud's documentation, which used reStructuredText and Sphinx-Doc, here’s how to get started contributing to the new version of the documentation.

You need four things to contribute to the documentation:

1. [Install Antora](./docs/install-antora.md).
2. Learn [the AsciiDoc file format's basics](./docs/asciidoc.md).
3. Update your toolset so that it supports both AsciiDoc and Antora.
4. Learn how to [build the docs](./docs/contributing.md).
