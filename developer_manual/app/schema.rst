===================
Database Migrations
===================

.. sectionauthor:: Thomas MÃ¼ller <thomas.mueller@tmit.eu>

ownCloud uses migration steps to perform any kind of changes between versions. In most cases these changes are changes
to the database schema but it is not only limited to them.

Therefore we support three kinds of migration steps: simple, sql and schema.

There are currently 3 types of migrations supported:

- simple: this allows general migration steps to be executed - pretty similar to the `repair steps <https://doc.owncloud.org/api/classes/OCP.Migration.IRepairStep.html>`_
- sql: this allows you to add a list of sql commands to be executed
- schema: migration steps of this kind allow various schema migration operations.

Starting with ownCloud 10 this is the preferred way to perform any kind of migrations and is enabled by default within core.
Any app which wants to use this mechanism has to enable it in :file:`appinfo/info.xml` by adding

.. code-block:: xml

  <use-migrations>true</use-migrations>


As soon as migrations are enabled any existing :file:`appinfo/database.xml` will be ignored on upgrade of the app.
Instead all migration steps which have not yet been executed will be executed.

It is still necessary to increment the apps version number to trigger the execution of steps.

How to develop a migration
==========================

1. Enable migrations by adding the xml tag to :file:`appinfo/info.xml`

.. code-block:: xml

  <use-migrations>true</use-migrations>

2. Create a migration step

.. code-block:: bash

  ./occ migrations:generate app-name {simple, sql, schema}

A simple migration step skeleton looks like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace OCA\testing\Migrations;

    use OCP\Migration\ISimpleMigration;
    use OCP\Migration\IOutput;

    /**
     * Auto-generated migration step: Please modify to your needs!
     */
    class Version20170213125339 implements ISimpleMigration {

        /**
         * @param IOutput $out
         */
        public function run(IOutput $out) {
            // auto-generated - please modify it to your needs
        }
    }

A sql migration step skeleton looks like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace OCA\testing\Migrations;

    use OCP\IDBConnection;
    use OCP\Migration\ISqlMigration;

    /**
     * Auto-generated migration step: Please modify to your needs!
     */
    class Version20170213125430 implements ISqlMigration {

        /**
         * @param IDBConnection $connection
         * @return array of sql statements
         */
        public function sql(IDBConnection $connection) {
            // auto-generated - please modify it to your needs
        }
    }

Within the sql() you can generate any number of sql commands which are returned as array. The statements are executed
after the method returns. Please do not directly execute any statements on the database parameter.
The parameter $connection can be used to e.g. get the database platform or to test if tables exist.

In order to allow cross compatible sql code please use the platform object or generate sql commands for each supported
database system.

A schema migration step skeleton looks like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace OCA\testing\Migrations;

    use Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema;
    use OCP\Migration\ISchemaMigration;

    /**
     * Auto-generated migration step: Please modify to your needs!
     */
    class Version20170213125427 implements ISchemaMigration {

        public function changeSchema(Schema $schema, array $options) {
            // auto-generated - please modify it to your needs
        }
    }

Within the changeSchema() method you can use the `Class Schema <http://www.doctrine-project.org/api/dbal/2.5/class-Doctrine.DBAL.Schema.Schema.html>`_
to manipulate the existing database schema. This is the preferred way to manipulate the schema.


3. Test your migration step by executing

.. code-block:: bash

   ./occ migrations:execute dav 20161130090952

Because all migration steps will be executed upon installation there is no explicit need for unit tests.

4. Bring the migration live

For the real app upgrade process the app version has to be increased to trigger the migrations.
This will apply all steps which have not yet been executed.



===============
Database Schema
===============

.. sectionauthor:: Bernhard Posselt <dev@bernhard-posselt.com>

ownCloud uses a database abstraction layer on top of either PDO, depending on the availability of PDO on the server.

The database schema is inside :file:`appinfo/database.xml` in MDB2's `XML scheme notation <http://www.wiltonhotel.com/_ext/pear/docs/MDB2/docs/xml_schema_documentation.html>`_ where the placeholders \*dbprefix* (\*PREFIX* in your SQL) and \*dbname* can be used for the configured database table prefix and database name.

An example database XML file would look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <database>
   <name>*dbname*</name>
   <create>true</create>
   <overwrite>false</overwrite>
   <charset>utf8</charset>
   <table>
    <name>*dbprefix*yourapp_items</name>
    <declaration>
      <field>
        <name>id</name>
        <type>integer</type>
        <default>0</default>
        <notnull>true</notnull>
            <autoincrement>1</autoincrement>
        <length>4</length>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>user</name>
        <type>text</type>
        <notnull>true</notnull>
        <length>64</length>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>name</name>
        <type>text</type>
        <notnull>true</notnull>
        <length>100</length>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>path</name>
        <type>clob</type>
        <notnull>true</notnull>
      </field>
    </declaration>
  </table>
  </database>

To update the tables used by the app, simply adjust the database.xml file and increase the app version number in :file:`appinfo/info.xml` to trigger an update.
