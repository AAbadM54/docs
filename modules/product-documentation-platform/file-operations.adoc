= File Operation Behaviour

This document details the behaviour of file operations on all platforms.

== Delete Files and Folders

Deleting files is a destructive operation, so a warning needs to be shown and confirmed by users.

== Move Files and Folders

A move action should open a file browser view, where users can choose the target directory.

== Copy Files and Folders

A copy action should open a file browser view, where users can choose the target directory.

== Name Conflicts

If file or folder names from uploads conflict with existing names, ownCloud should offer the following options:

* Add the item as a new version (files only)
* Add the item with a modified name (TBD)
* Overwrite the existing file or folder

== Permission Problems
