= Language Configuration

In normal cases ownCloud will automatically detect the language of the
Web-GUI. If this does not work properly or you want to make sure that
ownCloud always starts with a given language, you can use the
*default_language* parameter.

This parameters can be set in the _config/config.php_

[[parameters]]

<?php

  "default_language" => "en",
