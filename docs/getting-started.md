# Getting Started

This guide is here to help you get started with this repository, primarily if you've been contributing to the previous version of ownCloud's documentation, which used reStructuredText and Sphinx-Doc.

To contribute to the documentation, you need four things:

1. Learn [Antora's basics](https://antora.org).
2. Learn [the AsciiDoc file format's basics](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/).
3. Update your toolset so that it supports both AsciiDoc and Antora.
4. Start contributing to the new documentation repository.

To help you do that, this guide will step you through (or link you to) the required information and tools.
