Use the first spelling presented, and note that word presentations in the dictionary supersede the stylebook and Style Guide.

Capitalization
--------------

Titles of People and Terms Within Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People
^^^^^^

Capitalize a person's title only when it's used directly before a name. 
This rule includes titles pertaining to government positions (like *president*, *senator*, *mayor*, *ambassador*, and *chief justice*), religious positions (like *pope*, *cardinal*, and *rabbi*), and other organizational positions (like *chair*, *treasurer*, and *general manager*).

*Working Examples:**

- Felix Böhm is the Head of Customer Service of ownCloud
- ownCloud Head of Customer Service Felix Böhm
- She was appointed ambassador to the United Nations by President Obama
- The president returned to the Oval Office to greet the pope
- Pope Benedict XVI succeeded Pope John Paul II
- The school was treated to a visit by former President Jimmy Carter
- Shan Chu was named general manager of the Chicago region
- General Manager Shan Chu began her career in the mail room

Titles of Published Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Always Use Title Case.
""""""""""""""""""""""

*Working Examples*:

- Capitalize the first and last words, regardless of the length of the word or the part of speech.
- Capitalize all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns, regardless of the length of the word.
- Capitalize prepositions of four or more letters (like *over*, *from*, and *with*).
- Capitalize conjunctions of four or more letters (like *unless* and *than*), as well as *if* and *how* and *why*.

When Not to Capitalize
""""""""""""""""""""""

- Articles (*a*, *an*, and *the*).
- Prepositions of three or fewer letters (such as *of*, *in*, and *for*).
- Most conjunctions of three or fewer letters (like *as*, *and*, *or*, and *but*).
- The "to" in the infinitive form (e.g. *to* Code).

*Working Examples*:

- "Don't Fence Me In"
- "Walk With Me In Moonlight"
- "Turn Off the Lights, I'm Home" (*"Off" is an adverb here, part of the phrasal verb "turn off."*)
- "She Took the Deal off the Table" (*Here, "off" is a preposition.*)
- "What If I Do, What If She Won't"
- "The Least She Could Do Is Cry"

Branded Lowercase Proper Nouns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the first word in a title is a proper noun that begins with a lowercase letter (like *iPhone* or *danah boyd*), try to reorder the title so that you can capitalize the name as the company or person usually does.
If such a noun falls elsewhere in the title, use the company's capitalization style (iPhone). 
For instance, "*Sales of iPod Soar.*"

Numbers in Titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For specific instructions on how to handle numbers in titles, see the section on <<Numbers>>.

Hyphenated Compounds in Titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a hyphenated compound appears in title-style capitalization, capitalize the first word, and capitalize all subsequent words in the compound except for articles (*a*, *an*, and *the*), prepositions of three or fewer letters (like *to* and *of*), and coordinating conjunctions (*for*, *and*, *nor*, *but*, *or*, *yet*, and *so*).

Ask yourself:

> If this word weren't in a hyphenated compound, would I capitalize it? If the answer is yes, capitalize it as part of the hyphenated compound, too.

*Working Examples*:

- The Big Spender's Budget How-To (Capitalize any word, even "*to*" at the beginning or end of a title.)
- Author of How-To Book on Bee-Keeping Prone to Anaphylaxis
- Governor Slams E-Book About Her Re-Election Campaign
- Consumers Prefer Eco-Friendly and Cheap Products
- Two-Thirds Vote Needed to Fund Research into Blue-Green Algae Biofuel
- Profits Double on Word-of-Mouth Sales
- Audiences Love His Man-About-Town Sophistication
- Open Your Own eBay-based Boutique

Additional Tip
""""""""""""""

Verbs (even short ones like *is*, *be*, and *do*) should always be capitalized.
No matter how short, pronouns (such as *he*, *she*, *it*, *me*, and *you*) should be capitalized.
Capitalize both parts of phrasal verbs, multi-word verbs that include adverbs such as *up* and *out* (for example, tune in and hold on).
Phrasal verbs don't include the infinitive to form of a verb (*to be*, *to run*), so lowercase the word to in such a verb.

Punctuation
-----------

Colon
~~~~~

In a sentence, capitalize the first word after the colon if what follows the colon could function alone as a complete sentence. 
Use a single space following the colon. 
Place colons outside quotation marks when used together.

*Working Examples*:

- This is it: the chance we've been waiting for!
- This is it: We'll never have to work again!
- I feel sad when I hear the ending to "The Road Not Taken": "And that has made all the difference."

Comma
~~~~~

In a series consisting of three or more elements, separate the elements with commas. 
When a conjunction (like, and, or or) joins the last two elements in a series, include a comma before the conjunction.
Here are some examples:

- He went to Dewey, Cheatem, & Howe for financial advice.

Use the Oxford Comma
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Working Examples*:

- "I went to the shop with Jason, Jeremy, and Jessica."

Hyphen
~~~~~~

A hyphen is used to mean *to*, *up to* and *including*, or *through* in a range of numbers, dates, game scores, pages, and so on. 
It is also used to construct a compound adjective that includes a proper noun of more than one word. 
(*New York*, *Queen Elizabeth*, *Lake Baikal*, and *World War II* are all multiword proper nouns.)
If you are unsure whether a word combination should be two words, two hyphenated words, or one compound word, check {uri-cambridge-dictionary}[dictionary.cambridge.org].

*Working Examples*:

- Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) was president during the American Civil War (1861-1865)
- Jim was interested in the pre-Civil War era. (En dash connecting two-word proper noun "Civil War" with pre x "pre-")

Em Dash
~~~~~~~

Use an em dash to set apart entire phrases from the main body of a sentence, and separate the dashes from the words that precede and follow it with a space. 
When a date range has no ending date, use an em dash instead.

- The last place she expected to find him — if she ever found him at all — was in the back seat of her car.
- Mick Jagger (1943—), Brian Jones (1942-1969), and Keith Richards (1943—) were among the band's original members.

Numbers
-------

Numbers In Titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use numerals for cardinal and ordinal numbers in headlines, email subject lines, and HTML page titles.

- In Pamplona, 8 injured in "running of the bulls" (Headline)
- Subject: Presentation  file 1 of 2 attached (Email subject line)
- 5th Grader Wins 1st Place in Spelling Bee (Headline)

Cardinal Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spell out cardinal numbers (*one*, *two*, and so on) and ordinal numbers (*first*, *second*, and so on) below 10, but use numerals for numbers 10 and above.

Percentages
~~~~~~~~~~~

When expressing percentages, always use numerals and the percentage sign. Do not spell out percentages.

Time
~~~~

Always use **a.m.** and **p.m.** for indicating time. 
Use Eastern Standard Time (EST) when observing standard time (winter), and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when observing daylight saving time (summer).

- Read reviews of more than 350 restaurants in your city.
- Aunt Bea's pickles won first place at the fair.
- With a premium license, install the software on three computers.
- Does your building have a 13th floor?
- The study revealed that 8% of respondents were ambivalent.
- The webinar will be held on Friday, August 27 at 4 p.m. EDT.

Numerals As Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use numerals when referring to numbers that a person must type, such as for coordinates in tables and worksheets, and for parts of a document, such as page numbers or line references.

- Type 5 and press enter.
- Select row 3, column 5 of the worksheet.
- Refer to line 9 of the transcript.

Numerals In Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a passage contains two or more numbers that refer to the same category of information and one is 10 or higher, use numerals for all numbers referring to that category. 
When numbers are treated consistently, readers can recognize the relationship between them more easily.

- The delegation included 3 women and 11 men.
- He was the 9th person chosen for the 10-person team.
- The most popular vote-getters included three women and nine men.
- Only 3 women and 11 men attended the four-day event.

Large Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Express large and very large numbers in numerals followed by million, billion, and so forth. 
If expressing a number greater than 999 in numerals, use a comma.

- 5 billion people
- 1,200 years ago

Millions and Billions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When stating million or billion with a numeral, don't hyphenate, even before a noun. 
But do use a hyphen between the numeral and million or billion if the expression is part of a compound adjective that takes a hyphen elsewhere.

- A $6 million lawsuit
- The 400-million-served mark

If space is tight (for example, in headlines, tables, diagrams, or text messages), some abbreviations are acceptable.

- mil (million). see "mil."
- bil (billion). see "bil."
- k (thousand) - Among other things, K can stand for thousand, kilobytes, kilobits, and kilograms. Use K only if its meaning is clear from the context.

At the Beginning of a Sentence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid starting a sentence with a numeral. 
If you can't avoid it, spell out the number.

- 450 gamers participated in last night's chat. (don't)
- Four hundred and fifty gamers participated in last night's chat.
- Last night, 450 gamers participated in the chat.

A year may be written in numerals at the beginning of a sentence. 
It's okay to start a headline with a numeral if space is tight or if the numeral makes the headline more eye-catching or easier to scan or understand.

- 1967 was the Summer of Love in San Francisco.
- 8 Diet Tips
- Two 5-Year-Old Boys Found; One Still Missing

Ordinals and Suffixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid expressing ordinals with superscript letters (such as 10th, 11th, and so on). 
Ordinals with superscript formatted in a word processor may not display correctly in some places, such as email, and the use in writing of these suffixes is becoming increasingly archaic. 
Do not use "th" endings or their equivalent when stating dates (i.e., do not write Join us on June 10th).
