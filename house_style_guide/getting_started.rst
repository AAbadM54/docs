ownCloud House Style Guide
==========================

The ownCloud house style guide provides guidance (and some rules) for how the ownCloud documentation needs to be written.
Documentation, especially technical documentation, can be difficult to write, as it has so many different aspects, terms, components, and so on.
Given that, this guide has been created to provide a one-stop reference to refer to, should there be any questions as to what to do.
